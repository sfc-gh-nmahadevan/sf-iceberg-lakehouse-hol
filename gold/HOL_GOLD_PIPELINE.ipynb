    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook guides you through the setup and execution of the GOLD layer in your data pipeline using Snowflake and Iceberg tables. The GOLD layer focuses on curating aggregated and analytics-ready tables by leveraging the curated data from the SILVER and BRONZE layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will:\n",
    "- Import required Python packages and establish a Snowflake session.\n",
    "- Set up user-specific variables, roles, databases, and schemas for the GOLD layer.\n",
    "- Create dynamic Iceberg tables for key business entities and aggregations.\n",
    "- Join and enrich data from the SILVER and BRONZE layers to produce final reporting tables.\n",
    "- Create summary views for analytics and dashboarding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the instructions and code cells to complete the GOLD pipeline and prepare your data for business intelligence and advanced analytics."
